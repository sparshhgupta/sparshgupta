            I'm a passionate software engineer who loves solving real-world problems through technology. 
            With expertise in full-stack development, cloud computing, and machine learning, I enjoy 
            building impactful applications that combine clean code, scalability, and user-focused design. 
            Over the course of my academic journey and professional internships, I've worked on projects 
            ranging from intelligent AI systems to robust backend platforms and interactive web applications.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            My journey began with a strong foundation in Computer Science, where I developed a curiosity 
            for both software engineering and data-driven decision making. Since then, I've expanded my 
            skill set through diverse projects in areas like natural language processing, software fault 
            prediction, and scalable web systems. I thrive at the intersection of research and developmentâ€” 
            taking ideas from concept to working solutions while continuously learning new technologies.
